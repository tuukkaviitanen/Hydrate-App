# Hydrate-App
A drink-reminder-app created with .NET MAUI for Android with customisable drinking routine and Do-Not-Disturb-mode

## Info
- Created with .NET MAUI with .NET 7
- Currently only for Android as I have no iOS debugging available and Windows isn't supported by Plugin.LocalNotification NuGet package
- Created as a more customisable alternative for drink-reminder-apps I found in Play Store but with not as much extra stuff (ads & additional features)
- Every feature is designed so it can be easily disabled and customised
- New features might be added later if I find a need for them
